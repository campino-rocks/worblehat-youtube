Feature: Borrowing borrowed and available books

    Scenario Outline: Borrowed books cannot be borrowed again

        Given a library, containing only one book with isbn "<isbn>"

        When "<user>" borrows the book "<isbn>"
        Then the booklist lists "<user>" as borrower for the book with isbn "<isbn>"

        And there's an error "<message>", when "<user>" tries to borrow the book with isbn "<isbn>" again

        Examples:

            | isbn       | user      | message                       |
            | 0552131075 | user@test.com | The book is already borrowed. |

    Scenario: Borrow ignores whitespaces

        Given a library, containing only one book with isbn "0552131075"
        When "   test@me.com      " borrows the book "      0552131075"
        Then the booklist lists "test@me.com" as borrower for the book with isbn "0552131075"
