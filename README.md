## Developing the application

### Data base setup

A PostgreSQL data base can be started locally using docker-compose:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

The docker compose setup includes [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org) for adminstrating the data base.
Once the data base is started point your broser to http://localhost:8081 and log into the data base:

| Setting          | Value        |
|------------------|--------------|
| Data base system | PostgreSQL   |
| Server           | db           |
| User             | postgres     |
| Password         | worblehat-pw |
| Data base        | postgres     |
